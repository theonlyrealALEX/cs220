//! Assignment 3: Mastering common programming concepts (2/2).
//!
//! The primary goal of this assignment is to re-learn the common programming concepts in Rust, especially those in the Rust Book chapters 6, 7, 8, and 9.
//! Please make sure you're comfortable with the concepts to proceed on to the next assignments.
//!
//! You should fill out the `todo!()` placeholders in such a way that `/scripts/grade-03.sh` works fine.
//! See `assignment03_grade.rs` and `/scripts/grade-03.sh` for the test script.

/// Given a list of integers, returns its median (when sorted, the value in the middle position).

/// For a data set `x` of `n` elements, the median can be defined as follows:

/// - If `n` is even, the median is `(n/2)+1`-th smallest element of `x`.
